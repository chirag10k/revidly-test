Since your API SSL security certificate was expired earlier only so I have used two random images 
from the internet for the posts but the rest of the api data is from the given JSON API.
I have commented the code to display fetched images from the API at the same place where I have 
mentioned the url for the actually used images in common/widgets/post_card_widget.dart .
I had also mentioned this issue on Internshala chat earlier too.

I have used SQFLITE to store the data locally and displayed it when the device is offline. The app 
architecture is based on models, screens, common widgets and services using provider package.
